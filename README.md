# Leaflet-challenge
Building a tool that will allow 'The United States Geological Survey' to visualize their earthquake data. 
A data set of significant earthquaqes was chosen from USGS Geojson field. Using Leaflet,a map was created that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

The markers reflect the magnitude and depth of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.A legend was created that will provide context for the color ranges.
